A very simple PHP wrapper package for the official Riot League of Legends API. Each possible URL request is encapsulated in a method for each class. The JSON returned from each URL request is returned as an associative array. To use this framework, just include 'WrapperLibrary.php' in the file you want to use it in.

Note that there is a limit to the number of requests you can perform so try refreshing the page if your query doesn't work.
